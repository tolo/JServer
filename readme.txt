JServer Framework, version 2.2

http://www.jserver.org
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Introduction

JServer is a framework/SDK for developing component based standalone server 
side applications. The framework consists of an API for building and 
manipulating the component structure (tree) as well as a large library of 
useful packages, including for instance RPC/message based communication over 
a custom stream protocol, custom socket communication, basic HTTP support, 
object/thread/connection pooling, service discovery and registration, common 
administration interface (GUI and protocol), log management and property 
management.

See also the related (but standalone) project HotBeans 
(https://github.com/tolo/HotBeans), that provides support for hot 
deployable modules. 

JServer was initially created back in 1999 by John-John Roslund and Tobias 
LÃ¶fstrand while working at TeleTalk AB (later known as Link Messaging AB). 
In May 2007, the copyright was donated back from Link Messaging AB to the 
original creators, with the intent to publish the software as open source. 

The framework has been continuously developed and extended throughout the 
years, the latest additions being things like Spring and JBoss integration. 
Although some parts of JServer may be a bit dated and non-standard, the 
framework as a whole is still very useful in building distributed, robust 
and lightweight server side applications.

The plan for the future is to continue development and streamline the whole 
framework. This includes replacing and removing obsolete parts, improving the 
core functionality and increasing integration with other frameworks.

JServer is released under the terms of the Apache Software License, 
version 2.0 (see license.txt).

documentation available in javadoc format in the "docs" directory. A 
configuration reference document ("JServer Configuration.html") is also available 
in the docs directory.
