* First version after conversion to open source project.

* Project directory structure and build scripts updated.


Version 2.1.6 (20070508)

* Hot Beans messaging based administration package moved from hot beans into package com.teletalk.jserver.tcp.messaging.admin.hotbeans.

   - ServerFileData getServerFile(String)
   - void putServerFile(ServerFileData) 
   - boolean deleteServerFile(String)

   Applications using this class should be recompiled with the latest JServer version before deployment with it.

* Introduced flush interval property in FileDBQueueStorage. Default flush interval is 100.

Version 2.1.5 (20070423)

* Fix in SubComponent.getFullName to prevent a possible dead-lock situation.

* Increased default maxQueueSize in LogManager to 10000.

Version 2.1.5 (20070402)

* Added field messageHandlerThread to com.teletalk.jserver.tcp.messaging.Message keep track of a reference to the thread responsible for 
   handling the message. This makes it possible to log the stack trace of the thread in the event that a read time out occurs.
   
* Added class com.teletalk.jserver.queue.messaging.QueueSystemCommandConstants. This class contains message type constants and a method for getting 
   the appropriate message type given a certain queue system command class. New message types have also been added so that all queue system command 
   classes now have a specific message type.

Version 2.1.5 (20070207)

* StandaloneFileAppenderComponent can now be added to a LogManager by setting the field addToLogManager to true. StandaloneFileAppenderComponent 
   is now also equipped with a log filter that denies all logs from the standard JServer/Log4J framework, which means that it will log only messages that originates 
   from calls made directly on the component itself (i.e using for instance the log methods).

* Removed LoggableObject.log(LoggingEvent) for clarity reasons. Replaced by LoggableObject.getLogger().log(LoggingEvent).

* Fixed bugs in SpringApplicationContext related to registration of SubComponents/SubSystems. 

* SpringApplicationContext also supports Spring 2.0.

* Support has been added to SpringApplicationContext to inject references to core JServer systems. See JServerConstants for information about the 
   names of the core components (XXX_ALIAS constants).
