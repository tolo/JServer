/**
 * An pool implementation that contains thread objects that are ready to peform a special function. The ThreadPool class
 * uses three other classes to perform it's function; the PoolThread, PoolWorker and PoolCleaner classes. 
 * <br><br>
 * The PoolThread class implements the threads objects containd in the pool. It is also in essence a wrapper class for 
 * PoolWorker, an abstrat class which contains the implementation for the actual work each thread will perform. When using 
 * a ThreadPool a subclass to PoolWorker must be created and an implementaition for the <code>work</code> method 
 * provided.<br>
 * The preferred way of creating PoolWorkers for the pool is by specifying a {@link PoolWorkerFactory}.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * The PoolCleaner class is used in ObjectPool to check the consistency of the pool and clean out bad object. When used in conjunction with a ThreadPool, the 
 * PoolCleaner is given the added responsibility to detect errors that may occur any of the threads of the ThreadPool.
 * <br><br>
 * Note that the debug mode flag for each PoolThread/PoolWorker that is initialized will be set to the value of the debug mode property of 
 * this ThreadPool.
